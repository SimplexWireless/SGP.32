# SGP.32
this is a repository where we are putting generic scripts to work with eSIM SGP.22 and SGP.32 <br>
These are helper tools without any warranty with the hope that they help someone else on their journey to eSIM world<br>
We have not done extensive testing with different module vendors or EUMs.<br>
